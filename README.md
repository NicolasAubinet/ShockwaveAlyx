Shockwave Suit mod for Half Life Alyx.

<h1>Installation</h1>
Copy the contents of the "scripts" folder inside your “Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life Alyx” directory so that you’ll have a vscripts folder like this: “Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life Alyx\game\hlvr\scripts\vscripts”.
</br></br>
Run ShockwaveAlyx.exe (in the "application" folder), set your Half-Life Alyx folder correctly and it’s ready to be used. In the app, click "Connect" to have the suit connect. You can ensure that the connection is successful by clicking on the "Test haptics" button to send a haptic to your suit.
</br></br>
You need to run the game via the "Launch game" button (or alternatively, add the "-condebug" Steam launch parameter and run it from Steam).

<h1>Haptics list</h1>
It includes haptics for the following events (most haptics are still pretty basic at the moment):

- Directional damage

- Barnacle grab
- Drop / retrieve items to / from backpack
- Drop / retrieve items to / from hand item holders
- Health pen use

<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
If you encounter any problems running the app, install .NET version 5 here https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-5.0.17-windows-x64-installer
If it still doesn't work, uninstall other .NET versions and keep only this one. Some players encountered .NET version conflicts and keeping only this version fixes it.
